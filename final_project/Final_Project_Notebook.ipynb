    "Our project explores the challenge of visual question answering (VQA) -- given an image and an open ended question concerning the image, build a model that returns a correct answer. This topic requires synthesizing both visual and language modalities, and combining the two to produce a natural language answer, making it more challenging than traditional image classification. VQA challenges researchers to create networks with a more sophisticated level of understanding that could ultimately be used to help robots or drones navigate their environment. These networks could also give visually impaired people a more rich description of a scene, or be used for better image or product search within a database.\n"

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "For this project, we used the VQA v1.0 dataset, focusing on real images and open ended question answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br> The VQA 1.0 dataset is a collection of 82,783 MS COCO training images, 40,504 MS COCO validation images and 81,434 MS COCO testing images. Each image has 2-3 associated questions, for a total of 248,349 questions for training, 121,512 questions for validation and 244,302 questions for testing. Each question is associated with 10 ground truth answers, corresponding to the answers of 10 different human respondents when asked given the image-question pair. The dataset also includes a field identifying the most frequent ground truth answer of this set. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> There is a VQA 2.0 dataset that has been released, which utilizes the same set of MSCOCO images, but has more questions per image (443K total questions, as compared to 248K). Due to constraints on training time, we decided to use the VQA 1.0 dataset because it is about half the size.  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Questions are broken into 3 sub-groups, based on their answer types: \"yes/no\", \"number\", and \"other.\" The VQA challenge reports model accuracy for each sub-group, as well as an overall number. \n",

    "Rather than work off of the raw VQA v1.0 dataset, we used a preprocessed dataset available online courtesy of the [VT Vision Lab](https://github.com/VT-vision-lab). Instead of raw strings for questions, each word has been converted to an integer, which is then expanded to a 1-hot vector for multiplication with a GloVe embedding matrix. Instead of raw jpegs for images, we'll have the 4096-element embedding that results when you run the jpeg through VGG19 and look at the last fully connected layer('fc2'). <br>\n",

We left this as is originally, but later experimented with changing this to architecture described in the paper. \n",
    "\n",

   "source": [
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has 2 inputs: 1) a image and 2) a question about that image. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings for the input image are taken from the last hidden layer of VGG19, which is a 4096 dimensional vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vector is then normalized by dividing all elements by the L2-norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The normalized embedding is then fed to a fully connected layer with 1024 output neurons and a tanh activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Question Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a previously trained GloVe embedding matrix, 300 element word2vec representations are created for each word in the question. The sequence of vectors is then fed to an LSTM with 2 hidden layers (with dropout applied). The output of this LSTM is then connected to a dense layer with 1024 output nerons and a tanh activation function. Because the embedding layer is instantiated with the trainable parameter set to false, the GloVe embedding matrix weights are not adjusted during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining the two \n",
    "\n",
    "Having created two 1024 dimensional embeddings, one for the image and one for the question, the model then merges these two. This merging is done via elementwise multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting 1024-element vector is then fed to a fully connected layer with 1000 output neurons and a tanh activation function. From there, it is fed to another fully connected layer with \"num_classes\" output neurons. \"num_classes\" represents the number of answers possible for the questions; each neuron maps to one answer. A softmax activation is used to reflect the fact that the final output is a probability vector whose elements sum to 1. The numerical value at any particular element in the output vector represents the probability that answer is the correct one for a particular image-question pair. The model's answer is the the answer with the max probability in the output vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularization and Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses 50% dropout after the densely connected layers (except after the final dense layer), as well as between the 2 LSTM layers. The first iteration does not use L2 Regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses \"categorical_crossentropy\" as its loss function. This corresponds to the cross entropy metric defined in class; if $\\hat{y}$ is the softmax output reflecting probabilities weightings across all Z possible answers, then $y$ is a Z dimensions vector with a '1' at the position of the ground truth answer and '0' in all other positions. Given our specific dataset, the '1' is at the position of the most frequent answer given by the 10 human respondents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model uses RMSprop as its optimization algorithm, with default hyperparameters (this is suggested in Keras documentation). Learning rate is 0.001, $\\rho$ is 0.9 (this was $\\beta$ in our lecture videos; the weighting of the current gradient relative to the historical average), $\\epsilon=1*10^{-8}$ (this is the 'fuzz' factor to protect against divide by zero errors), and learning rate decay is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later changes were made to this loss function, as described [here](#loss_function_mods). \n",

    "\n",
    "Most best-in-class VQA models (including first place in this year's competition [ [1] ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02711.pdf)) use ResNet encodings instead of VGG19. However, they generally use ResNet-101 or ResNet-152. \n",
    "\n",
    "We, however, decided to try encodings from ResNet50. Relative to VGG19, ResNet50 is far smaller (25.5M params versus 143.6M), which means it should run faster and be less memory intensive. Therefore, if we could even prove similar prediction accuracy with ResNet50, this would be an improvement, since it makes the ultimate model smaller. It was also convenient that Keras has a ResNet50 implementation that can be easily imported. \n",
    "\n",
    "We chose the penultimate layer of Resnet50, which consists of a (2048,1) embedding for a given image. Note that this is half the size of the VGG19 embedding, so we had to modify our model to account for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than connect the ResNet50 model to the front end of our existing VQA model, we decided to pre-compute the embeddings to save on future training time. To do this, we had to download all 80K MSCOCO images, run them through ResNet50, and create a new HDF5 dataset of (2048,1) embeddings which could then be fed to our VQA model. The code to do this is under the `Supplementary Code` directory in `create_h5dataset.py` and `create_resnet_embeddings.py`"

The idea is that using concatenation or elementwise multiplication to combine image and question embeddings (each of which represents information from a different modality, hence the term “multimodal”) may limit model performance. A more sophisticated approach to fusing these two might be necessary.\n",

    "\n",
    "A substantial amount of time was invested in creating a model that implemented attention but to little avail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team did succeed in defining the attention architecture proposed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02711.pdf), the VQA v2.0 winner. Generally, the architecture involves looked at the 2048 channel feature vector for a (7,7) grid over the image. For the 49 grid squares, the 2048 channel embedding is concatenated with the question embedding out of the LSTM. The result is then passed through several fully connected layers to create an attention vector of length 49. That 49 element attention vector is then multiplied with the (49,2048) original image embedding to return a (1,2048) image embedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "This image embedding is shrunk to 512 elements via a dense layer. It is then combined with the original question embedding via elementwise multiplication and passed through dense layers, retaining pretty much the same architecture as in our original model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge run into was actually in creating the (7,7,2048) size embedding for each image in the dataset. This involved running all 80k images in the dataset through ResNet50 and extracting information from the appropriate layer. However, once generated, this resulted in a dataset that was prohibitively large (>40GB). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of how large the dataset was, it could no longer be completely loaded into memory, which meant we had to write a DataGenerator function to batch the loading of the dataset. "

Eventually, we realized this, and created an 8600 element dataset of 49x2048 resnet image embeddings (flattened from the 7x7x2048 output) and questions, and tested the model to see if it could fit this data. \n"

All models on the leaderboard for the VQA challenge implement some form of attention. Once a basic attention model has been tuned, we could experiment with being smarter about the image regions considered for attention. Rather than looking at attention for a 7x7 square grid superimposed on the image, we could create an attention vector for a set of boxes that we know identify particular objects/regions of interest in the image. One might imagine taking the objects localized by a YOLO Model and using those as the inputs to the attention model. \n",

    "__Stephanie Dong:__ Stephanie worked on experiments comparing element-wise product, vector concatination, and multimodal compact bilinear pooling as the merge layer between image and question embeddings, including implementing a custom keras layer for compact bilinear pooling. In addition, she implemented label generation from question-image annotations to produce weighted labels for soft cross entropy loss. Lastly, she contributed to the project infrastucture, including plotting and saving training history over disjoint sessions, and the final project writeup.\n",

    "__Alona King:__ Alona researched various infrastructures to for the project, worked on the loss function for the infrastructure we chose, and created the final presentation for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Jennifer Villa:__ Jennifer worked on the experiments contrasting concatenation with using the last LSTM hidden state for the question embeddings. She also generated the ResNet50 embeddings for the dataset images, and ran the experiments comparing ResNet50 image embeddings with those from VGG19. In addition, she implemented the attention model and generated the new set of ResNet50 embeddings required (from an earlier layer). Lastly, she contributed to the final project writeup, including developing the demo portion. "
