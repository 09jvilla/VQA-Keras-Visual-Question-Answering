    "Our project explores the challenge of visual question answering (VQA) -- given an image and an open ended question concerning the image, build a model that returns a correct answer. This topic requires synthesizing both visual and language modalities, and combining the two to produce a natural language answer, making it more challenging than traditional image classification. VQA challenges researchers to create networks with a more sophisticated level of understanding that could ultimately be used to help robots or drones navigate their environment. These networks could also give visually impaired people a more rich description of a scene, or be used for better image or product search within a database.\n"

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "For this project, we will be using the VQA v2.0 dataset. Unlike VQA 1.0, which included both real and abstract scenes, VQA 2.0 only looks at real images. The task is also slightly different between versions - v1.0 included both open ended and multiple choice question answering, whereas v2.0 focuses exclusively on open ended question answering. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br> The VQA 2.0 dataset is a collection of 82,783 MS COCO training images, 40,504 MS COCO validation images and 81,434 MS COCO testing images. Each image has 3+ associated questions, for a total of 443,757 questions for training, 214,354 questions for validation and 447,793 questions for testing. Each question is associated with 10 ground truth answers, corresponding to the answers of 10 different human respondents when asked given the image-question pair. The dataset also includes a field identifying the most frequent ground truth answer of this set. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> Questions are broken into 3 sub-groups, based on their answer types: \"yes/no\", \"number\", and \"other.\" The VQA challenge reports model accuracy for each sub-group, as well as an overall number. \n",

    "\n",
    "Question:  What is hanging above the toilet? <br> <img src=\"TeddyBear.png\"> <br>  Answer: teddy bear\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> VQA 2.0 also includes a \"complementary pairs\" dataset. These are pairs of images that share the same question, but the answer to that question is different for each image (see below for example). Some [research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00837.pdf) has shown that training with this dataset improves model accuracy and prevents the model from overfitting to the most common answers. As of now, we are not using this dataset, but we may investigate using it as an extension.  <img src=\"PairedImages.png\"> "

    "### Merge Layer Deprecation\n",
    "When we ran the initial model, we saw warnings that as of Keras 2.0, the Merge layer used in `vqa_model()` has been deprecated. The suggested fix would be to instead use a Multiply layer to perform the elementwise multiplication, but the Multiply layer will only accept tensors. Several workarounds were tried, including using the new Multiply layer with \"vgg_model.output\" and \"lstm_model.output\", but we ran into issues there because we were using \"symbolic tensors\" rather than actual tensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proper approach, recommended by the Keras development community, is to switch from sequential style models, heavily utilized in Keras 1.0, to functional models, recommanded de-facto for Keras 2.0. Hence, we have redefined our models in functional Keras syntax."

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "1. **Test different image embeddings**: Currently, our model uses image embeddings taken from the last hidden layer of VGG19. We would like to test the performance of embeddings taken from other well-known CNN models. Keras has [open source implementations](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/keras/applications) of Resnet-50, Inception-Resnet_v2, Inception_v3, and Xception. A search of Github also reveals a Keras [Resnet-152](https://gist.github.com/flyyufelix/7e2eafb149f72f4d38dd661882c554a6) implementation, which might also be worth trying since this was the [model](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2748290.pdf) used by another Stanford team. As with our existing model, it probably makes sense to pre-compute the image features by running the VQA dataset images through the chosen network for embedding. Using our new set of image features, we can re-train our model to see if we can achieve better accuracy. \n",
    "2. **Implement New Cost Function for Soft Cross Entropy Loss**: Currently our model uses binary cross-entropy loss, with the ground-truth answer being a one-hot vector encoding the answer given by the majority of the human respondents polled. However, the VQA metric actually awards partial credit to models that output answers that match any of the ten human respondent answers. Thus, there is currently a disconnect between the loss function and the evaluation metric. One of the top performers in this year's VQA challenge sought to address this by proposing a [soft cross entropy loss](https://ilija139.github.io/pub/cvpr2017_vqa.pdf) function. This function calculates a weighted average of all unique ground truth answers given by the 10 human respondents. In the paper, these researchers achieved ~1.2-1.6% improved accuracy across a variety of model architectures. We would like to see if this improvement translates to our model as well. \n",
    "3. **Implement Multi-Modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling**: The [second place winner](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01471.pdf) in this year’s VQA challenge proposed the concept of multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling. The idea is that using concatenation or elementwise multiplication to combine image and question embeddings (each of which represents information from a different modality, hence the term “multi-modal”) may limit model performance. A more sophisticated approach to fusing these two might be necessary. Thus they proposed “multi-modal factorized bilinear pooling”, which amounts to a combination of element-wise multiplication, fully connected layers, and sum pooling. We would like to see the impact of substituting this technique in place of our current “Multiply” layer in our VQA model. Once we implement co-attention (see $4$), we could also incorporate this technique into that model. (Authors of the original paper saw improvement in both simpler model architectures, such as the one we currently have, and those with co-attention).\n",
    "4. **Implement Image-Question Co-attention**: All of the top performing VQA models use some form of attention. While early research focused exclusively on image attention [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07394), more recent work has combined image attention with question attention [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061) [[3]](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/2748290.pdf). The philosophy behind the latter approach is just as certain regions of the image are more relevant than others, certain words in the question are more helpful in answering than others. A variety of different co-attention architectures have been proposed, including hierarchical co-attention, which looks at question attention recursively on word, phrase, and full question levels. Other co-attention models (like [3]) include information indicating the part of speech of a word. We plan on starting with an architecture like the one proposed in the \"Multi-Modal Factorized Bilinear Pooling\" paper, which won second place [[4]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.01471.pdf). The experimenters provide their [source code](https://github.com/yuzcccc/vqa-mfb), but it is written in Caffe. \n"

Now we'll fix that and retrain to see if our accuracy is improved by using the cell ('c') and hidden ('h') output of both LSTM hidden layers. This is what the original [VQA paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.00468v6.pdf) describes doing. "
